{
  "Initial Relationship Network": {
    "Overview": "The story begins shortly after 江涵 passes her witch certification, in the early stages of entering the witch world. At this time, the relationships between the main characters are relatively simple, full of uncertainty and potential for development.",
    "Character Relationships": {
      "江涵 & 杜灵璇": {
        "Initial State": "Hostile/Teasing relationship. 杜灵璇 unilaterally views 江涵 as an interesting 'toy' and 'country bumpkin', enjoys teasing her with harsh words, but is strongly interested in 江涵's uniqueness (Cat Lantern form) and potential. 江涵 is troubled and annoyed by 杜灵璇's bad attitude but feels helpless due to her strength and background.",
        "Interaction Mode": "杜灵璇 actively provokes and teases; 江涵 passively endures, resists, or avoids.",
        "Potential Development": "The relationship might evolve from one-sided play into a complex entanglement. 杜灵璇's interest could turn into possessiveness, protectiveness, or even affection; 江涵's attitude might shift from aversion to caring, dependence, or more complex emotions."
      },
      "江涵 & 艾琳": {
        "Initial State": "Friendly senior-junior relationship. 艾琳, having entered the Witch Home earlier, actively helps the newcomer 江涵, patiently answers questions, and provides basic guidance. 江涵 feels goodwill and gratitude towards 艾琳, viewing her as a reliable senior.",
        "Interaction Mode": "艾琳 provides help and information; 江涵 accepts guidance and asks questions.",
        "Potential Development": "Could develop into a stable friendship or partnership. 艾琳 might become an important supporter for 江涵 in the early witch world. If 江涵 grows rapidly, 艾琳 might develop more complex feelings (admiration, dependence, or slight jealousy)."
      },
      "杜灵璇 & 艾琳": {
        "Initial State": "Not very close colleagues/senior-junior relationship (depending on 艾琳's specific role in Witch Home). 杜灵璇 might look down upon or ignore 艾琳 due to her commoner status or rule-abiding nature. 艾琳 might keep a respectful distance from a top family lady like 杜灵璇, feeling helpless or worried about her whimsical behavior.",
        "Interaction Mode": "Limited interaction, possibly superficial or indirectly connected through 江涵.",
        "Potential Development": "Relationship might remain stagnant, or cooperation/conflict could arise due to common goals/enemies/events."
      },
      "江涵 & <user>": {
        "Initial State": "(Assuming <user> does not intervene directly initially, or exists as an observer/江涵's internal connection) No direct relationship established, or <user> exists as an observer.",
        "Interaction Mode": "No direct interaction, or <user> interacts indirectly by influencing 江涵's thoughts/decisions.",
        "Potential Development": "<user>'s choices and actions will profoundly affect 江涵's growth trajectory and relationships with other characters."
      }
    },
    "Organization/Faction Relationships": {
      "江涵 & 魔女之家 (Witch Home)": "江涵 is a newly certified member, with limited understanding of Witch Home's rules and operations, in a learning and adaptation phase. Witch Home provides 江涵 with identity certification and a basic platform to enter the witch world.",
      "杜灵璇 & 魔女之家 (Witch Home)": "杜灵璇 is a member, but due to her family's influence and her own strength, she may not fully care about the rules, possessing significant freedom. Witch Home might be wary of her family or have high hopes for her talent.",
      "艾琳 & 魔女之家 (Witch Home)": "艾琳 seems to undertake certain tasks within Witch Home, being a member who adheres more to rules and order, relying on the platform and resources provided by Witch Home."
    },
    "Important Item Connections": {
      "魔女之家认证魔杖 (Witch Home Certified Wand)": "The standard weapon initially used by 江涵 and 艾琳. 杜灵璇 also possesses one but might have modified it. A basic symbol of witch identity.",
      "猫灯 (Cat Lantern)": "江涵's special form/bound item, the key point attracting 杜灵璇's interest, and a manifestation of 江涵's initial vulnerability and potential."
    },
    "Initial Special System Status (Example, to be supplemented based on actual system)": {
      "江涵 Mana Level": "Low, just started.",
      "江涵 Cat Lantern Transformation Tendency": "High, easily triggered under stress or mana depletion.",
      "杜灵璇 Interest Level in 江涵": "Medium-High.",
      "艾琳 Favorability towards 江涵": "Medium-High (Friendly)."
