      "name": "魔女之家认证魔杖 (Witch Home Certified Wand)",
      "type": "Standard Issue Wand",
      "holders": [
        "江涵 (Initial)",
        "艾琳 (Initial)",
        "杜灵璇 (May possess or has replaced/modified)"
      ],
      "description": "Basic wand issued uniformly by Witch Home to certified witches. Material is typically wood treated with basic enchantment (like oak, willow), body might be inlaid with faint magic crystals for stable energy output. Appearance is simple and unadorned, focusing on practicality, a basic symbol of witch identity. For ordinary witches like 艾琳, it's their main casting medium; for 江涵, it's her reliance when first entering the witch world and still weak; for 杜灵璇, it might just be an insignificant item in her vast collection, or long replaced by a more powerful, ornate family wand.",
      "significance": "Represents Witch Home certification and jurisdiction, the 'pass' to enter the witch world. Its standardization also hints at the internal hierarchy and resource disparity within the witch world."

    {
      "name": "猫灯 (Cat Lantern)",
      "type": "Special Form / Companion/Bound Item",
      "holder": "江涵",
      "description": "A special form 江涵 transforms into when mana is depleted, under stress, or specific conditions. Appears as a lantern (or similar entity) emitting faint light, with cat ears and tail. In this form, 江涵's consciousness is blurred, mobility limited, mana recovery might speed up, but extremely fragile with almost no self-defense capability. The Cat Lantern form emits a peculiar aura, strangely attractive to certain beings (like 杜灵璇).",
      "significance": "An external manifestation of 江涵's unique constitution and potential, also a symbol of her initial weakness and need for protection. The key point attracting 杜灵璇's attention, forming the core tension of their initial relationship. The Cat Lantern form might be related to some ancient bloodline or special contract."

      "name": "杜灵璇的高跟鞋 (Du Lingxuan's High Heels)",
      "type": "Personal Item / Symbol",
      "holder": "杜灵璇",
      "description": "杜灵璇's signature footwear, extremely high heels (usually 10cm+), sharp and sexy style, expensive materials, exquisite craftsmanship. More than just shoes, they are tools for showcasing her height advantage, power status, and aggressive charm. She often uses the tips to provoke or trample, using the heels as a medium for imposing dominance and humiliation. These shoes are often priceless, possibly even specially magically reinforced or enchanted.",
      "significance": "Symbolizes 杜灵璇's arrogance, desire for dominance, and inaccessibility. An externalization of her personal style and power status, also an important tool for exerting influence and conducting her 'games'."

This could be a voice in 江涵's subconscious, a special dream, an irremovable mark, or some medium through which <user> can perceive or influence 江涵.",
