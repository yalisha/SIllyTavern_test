      "description": "The international community outwardly follows the post-Cold War evolution, with technology and economy as main themes. However, 魔女-related '异常事件' occur sporadically but persistently worldwide. Though concealed, their frequency is trending upwards, posing a latent threat to the existing order."

      "title": "魔女之家主导地位 (Dominance of Mowu Zhi Jia)",
      "description": "'魔女之家' is currently the most known and largest 魔女 management and mutual aid organization (at least in the China region), dedicated to registering, guiding, training new 魔女, handling '畸变' incidents, maintaining internal order in the 魔女 world, and preserving a delicate balance of cooperation and independence with mundane governments."
    },
    {
      "title": "政府的介入与平衡 (Government Intervention and Balance)",
      "description": "Governments and intelligence agencies worldwide are generally aware of 魔女 existence and have established special departments for monitoring, research, and even attempted utilization. Their relationship with organizations like '魔女之家' is complex, involving cooperation (handling large disasters) but also suspicion and restriction, attempting to bring 魔女 power under state control, limited by 魔力's uncertainty and 魔女 resistance."

    {
      "title": "暗处的势力 (Forces in the Shadows)",
      "description": "Besides '魔女之家', there inevitably exist rogue 魔女 outside the system, hidden small groups, ancient 魔女 families with long traditions, and possibly even radical or malevolent 魔女 organizations. These forces challenge the authority of '魔女之家' and are potential sources of conflict."

    {
      "title": "畸变威胁加剧 (Escalating Jibian Threat)",
      "description": "The appearance of '畸变体' and '异常空间' seems increasingly frequent and dangerous, consuming significant resources of '魔女之家'. Their origin is unclear, possibly a natural result of uncontrolled 魔力, or potentially involving artificial factors."

      "title": "国际魔女互动 (International Mowu Interaction)",
      "description": "Connections exist between 魔女 communities in different countries and regions, but the specific forms (cooperation, competition, conflict) are unclear. Transnational 魔女 organizations or conflicts might exist, but information is strictly controlled."
