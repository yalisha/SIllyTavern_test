Mysterious Revival - Plot Summary
Prologue: Collapse of the Ordinary, Descent of Terror
The story unfolds in a seemingly ordinary modern society, yet a terror lurking beneath the surface is quietly awakening. Supernatural forces begin to revive, manifesting in a form that defies comprehension and cannot be eradicated by conventional means—"ghosts." These ghosts are not traditional spirits but rather phenomena governed by specific "patterns," bringing death and despair. Ordinary people remain oblivious until the horror strikes them personally.
The protagonist, <user>, starts as an ordinary high school senior at Dachang City’s No. 7 High School. His/her life takes a drastic turn after a bizarre "safety lecture." A man claiming to be an Interpol officer, Zhou Zheng, with an extremely abnormal appearance (emaciated, bloated, and chillingly cold), bursts into the evening self-study class. He frantically warns the students about the existence of "ghosts"—entities that cannot be killed, can only be countered by other ghosts, and require understanding their patterns to survive. His words are met with ridicule by most, but an unsettling tension begins to permeate the air.
Soon, the lecture’s warnings become reality. The "Knocking Ghost" incident erupts at No. 7 High School. A menacing ghost resembling an elderly man in a black shirt with corpse-like spots on its face appears on campus, killing through a specific knocking sound, its presence accompanied by rapid aging and decay of the surroundings. <user> and his classmates, including best friend Zhang Wei, the later-significant Wang Shanshan, survivor Miao Xiaoshan, and others, are thrust into this sudden life-or-death crisis. Amid the chaos, <user> displays extraordinary calmness and survival instinct. Crucially, in a moment of desperation and near-death, he is parasitized by a "Ghost Eye" originating from Zhang Dong, a top ghost tamer from the Republic era. This Ghost Eye grants him the ability to see through illusions, create a ghost domain, and later "restart" his own state—a powerful supernatural ability. However, it also sets him on the irreversible path of a "ghost tamer," perpetually at risk of being fully consumed by the malevolent ghost within him and "reviving" as one himself.
Phase One: Struggling to Survive, Taming the Ghosts
After gaining the power of the Ghost Eye, <user>’s life is irrevocably altered. No longer an ordinary student, he becomes a "ghost tamer," burdened by the curse of ghost revival and walking the line between reality and the supernatural. He gradually uncovers the brutal truth of this world: ghosts run rampant, and while an official organization (Headquarters) exists, it struggles to cope with the escalating supernatural disasters. Survival becomes the top priority, and humanity grows cheap under the crushing weight of absolute terror and desperation.
To stay alive and protect his family (his mother and younger sister Yang Xiaohua), <user> begins actively engaging with supernatural incidents, using the Ghost Eye to resolve crises—though this accelerates his own revival. He encounters a series of eerie events like the "Ghost Mirror" and "Ghost Cabinet," comes into contact with dangerous supernatural items like the misleading yet informative "Human Skin Paper," and relies on limited tools such as "Ghost Candles," "Coffin Nails," and "Gold Objects" to combat ghosts.
A milestone in this phase is the "Starving Ghost Incident." Facing an S-class ghost with the ability to devour and split, Dachang City nearly falls. <user> narrowly survives, gaining a deeper understanding of the terror of S-class ghosts. In a desperate bid, he manages to tame the core fragments of the Starving Ghost—a "Headless Ghost Shadow" and a "Ghost Hand." The Ghost Shadow grants him the ability to substitute death and invade shadows, while the Ghost Hand provides immense physical suppression. This creates a dangerous balance within him—Ghost Eye, Ghost Shadow, and Ghost Hand restraining and accelerating each other’s revival. His power surges, but he drifts further from humanity. His demeanor grows increasingly cold, decisive, and even ruthless, willing to do anything to survive and achieve his goals.
Phase Two: Rising Fame, Expanding Horizons
With growing strength and a track record of resolving multiple incidents, <user> catches the attention of Headquarters’ leadership. He is exceptionally promoted to one of the twelve captains (the Enforcement Captain), tasked with handling the highest-level supernatural events. This grants him greater authority and resources but also heavier responsibilities, exposing him to higher-level information and a broader world.
Ghost Painting Incident: <user> confronts "Ghost Painting," an S-class ghost once tamed by former captain He Yuelian. With its own painting-world ghost domain and the ability to kill through memories, this incident exposes <user> to more diverse and bizarre S-class ghosts, while also sparking tension with the unstable He Yuelian.

Ghost Post Office Journey: To address his own condition or related events, <user> repeatedly ventures into the "Ghost Post Office," an independent supernatural space. It forces ghost tamers to deliver letters as couriers, with higher floors offering deadlier tasks but potentially greater power or critical information. Here, <user> uncovers secrets behind the Ghost Post Office and encounters figures like Zhang Xianguang, hinting at deeper manipulations and conspiracies in the supernatural world.

Major Battles and Captain Duties: As a captain, <user> tackles broader, more dangerous incidents. The "Ghost Lake/Ghost Ship Incident" marks a turning point. A ghost lake in Dazhou City unleashes countless ghosts, followed by a Republic-era ghost ship’s arrival, sparking an unprecedented crisis. Headquarters assembles a force including <user>, Ye Zhen, Liu San, Li Jun, Cao Yang, Lin Bei, and veteran titan Qin Lao. The battle is devastating—Headquarters suffers heavy losses, with captains like Li Jun, Cao Yang, and Lin Bei dying or disappearing, and the revered Qin Lao sacrificing himself to seal the ghost ship. Headquarters’ power weakens, elevating <user> and the new generation of captains, but exposing humanity’s fragility against top-tier supernatural forces.

In this phase, <user>’s power grows (his ghost domain reaches four layers, unlocking the "restart" ability), and he begins building his own faction (recruiting Feng Quan, Li Yang, Huang Ziya, and others into a tight-knit "circle of friends"). He navigates complex alliances and conflicts with other captains and factions (like Ye Zhen of Dahai City, the supernatural forum, and Headquarters’ internal cliques). His relationship with Wang Shanshan also deepens, her unique memory-based supernatural ability growing increasingly vital.
Phase Three: Power Struggles, Uncovering the Past
As the old guard of captains fades and Headquarters weakens, the supernatural world enters a new era of turmoil. With his immense strength and ruthless tactics, <user> becomes a pivotal figure in the supernatural community, but also makes many enemies.
Clash with the Kings Organization: The foreign ghost tamer group "Kings Organization" invades, clashing with Headquarters. <user>, a key combatant, faces off against their elite (like the "Kings") in life-or-death battles, solidifying his status but highlighting the global severity of supernatural threats.

Internal Strife and Consolidation: Tensions within Headquarters and between factions intensify. To survive and grow, <user> engages in brutal power struggles, eliminating rivals, consolidating resources, and even clashing with fellow captains. His "circle of friends" evolves from a loose alliance into a formidable force under his absolute control.

Exploring Republic-Era Secrets: Seeking to suppress his revival or uncover the ultimate truth of the supernatural, <user> digs into Republic-era clues. He learns more about figures like Zhang Dong, He Yiner, and Hong Jie (Zhang Youhong), exploring their relics (like enhanced ghost coffins and coffin nails) and sites to understand their methods against the supernatural and the origins of the modern revival. He may encounter terrifying entities from that era still "alive" today.

Deepening and Alienation of Powers: <user>’s ghost domain reaches higher layers (five, six, or even nearing seven), with his "restart" ability refined but costlier. His balance over his internal ghosts peaks, yet his "non-human" traits intensify, his humanity eroding as his thoughts and actions align more with ghosts.

Phase Four: Apocalyptic Vision, Ultimate Quest
(Based on the novel’s later trends and common endgame speculation)
The tide of supernatural revival surges, with S-class incidents rampant and even beyond-S-class conceptual or rule-based horrors threatening global annihilation. Humanity’s living space shrinks, and Headquarters teeters on collapse.
Confronting Ultimate Terrors: <user> and other peak ghost tamers face the root causes of the revival—hidden masterminds or uncontrollable rule-defying ghosts born from the chaos. Battles shift from physical to clashes of supernatural rules, overwriting and altering each other.

Seeking a "Solution": The core conflict pivots to finding a true resolution to the revival—restarting the world, altering its rules, tracing the source of supernatural power, or forging a new coexistence. Republic-era secrets may hold the key.

<user>’s Final Transformation: To face the ultimate crisis, <user> may fully embrace his internal ghosts, even willingly reviving completely to gain supreme power as a non-human entity. His fate could be to become a new "god" or "ghost" safeguarding humanity’s remnants—or to perish in the struggle.

Fates of Companions: Zhang Wei’s luck, Wang Shanshan’s memory ability, and other surviving allies meet their ends in this final wave—sacrificing themselves, finding their paths, or fading into history.

Conclusion: A Song of Struggle in the Darkness
Mysterious Revival paints an intensely dark, oppressive, and despairing world where hope is a luxury and survival the sole aim. <user>’s journey from an ordinary person to a top ghost tamer is steeped in blood, struggle, and a relentless questioning of humanity. He is no traditional hero—his coldness, selfishness, and ruthlessness are armor forged to endure apocalyptic terror. The story’s allure lies in its masterful depiction of dread, intricate design of ghost "patterns," and profound exploration of human struggle in an apocalyptic abyss. Though light is faint, the cost immense, and the path unclear, <user> and his fellow ghost tamers persist in humanity’s final, tragic stand against the endless dark.
