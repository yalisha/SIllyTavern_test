POWERCHART

Bellona Stats

Characters Average Stats

PROS & CONS

Skill synergy with using S3>S2>S1 then activate S3 again

Strong AoE attacks

AoE defense break on skill 3

Skill one has scales with enemy health%, so its useful against high hp bosses

She is countered by debuff immunity (can't land defense break)

If built with pure DPS and speed, she will be squishy



Tier List Description

[5/9/2024 Update]: Her S1 can soul burn for extra turn.

A decent AoE attacker that is good for newbies. Her skill 3 is an AoE defense break. Her skill 2 is an AoE attack that grants 1 turn immunity. Her basic attack has percent health damage, which is good against bosses.

Her skill rotation is S3>S2>S1 + free S3. She can also activate a free S3 if she gets a dual attack on her S1 as well. This means Rosa Hargana is a great item for her.

She excels in all content, both PvE and PvP. Can shred bosses and regular monsters. The only downside is her lower base attack but that would be nit picking, considering the utility and damage she brings to the team.

With the addition of her Exclusive Equipment, she can be played differently. She can dispel 1 buff via S2, increase defense break chance by 20% or decrease enemy combat readiness.


RECOMMENDED ARTIFACTS


Rosa Hargana
Extra Attack
Best in slot to get some more dual attacks to gain focus stacks for the nasty proc of her skill 3.

Bloodstone
Healing
Her high damage means Bloodstone heals a lot more than other rangers.

Reingar’s Special Drink
Extra Damage
[LIMITED ARTIFACT] Since she has 2 AoE skills (one of which can be triggered by her S1), she'll end up proc'ing this Artifact a lot.

Iron Fan
Banshee Artifact
Surprisingly, Bellona is pretty good on Iron Fan against the Banshee, as it's more damage against Ice Units (in a Hunt where all the enemies are Ice).

AdDITIONAL INFO

Here is Grass Angel’s view on Bellona:


Here is Je Hae Gwon using Bellona in Banshee Hunt 11 auto:


Here is some Bellona Challenger Arena action from TKGallant:


Also, a lot of people are discussing her on Reddit about her:




ARENA TEAMS

Celestial Mercedes Cleave (TK Gallant)
Arena Level: Challenger


    Celestial Mercedes
 
Kal'adra
    Schuri
 
Sashe Ithanes
    Rose
 
Card of Small Miracles
    Bellona
 
Rosa Hargana

Comments

TK uses Celestial Mercedes alongside Bellona to cleave enemies in challenger. This team is great and can help you stay in challenger to get the sweet skystones. You can also replace the artifact of C Mercedes with Necro and Undine (limited) from Dizzy’s banner. That almost guarentees she goes again after using her S3.
