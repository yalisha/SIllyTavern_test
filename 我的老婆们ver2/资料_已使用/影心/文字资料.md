Overview
For a full overview of Shadowheart's starting features, see the articles Cleric, Trickery Domain and High Half-Elf.
Background
A devout follower of the Lady of Loss, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within. Her faith plays an important part in her story throughout the game, and she can be steered towards or away from it.

Starting class
Before she is recruited, Shadowheart is a level 1 Cleric with the following Ability Scores: STR = 12, DEX = 13, CON = 14, INT = 10, WIS = 15, CH = 8.

If recruited, Shadowheart reverts to a level 1 Cleric with the standard ability scores for that Class. She starts with the Trickery Domain subclass, giving her access to Spellcasting – with a particular focus on Illusion magic – and 
Blessing of the Trickster
 Blessing of the Trickster, a class action that grants another creature advantage on Stealth checks. This makes her an ideal support character, albeit with few offensive options.

Special features
Shadowheart has the passive 
Fear of Wolves
 Fear of Wolves: whenever a wolf approaches her, she must make a Wisdom saving throw or become 
Frightened
 Frightened.
Shar Shar, Shadowheart's goddess, plays an integral part in her story, and is far more involved in her life than the standard Cleric class experience.
Shar's patronage grants Shadowheart resistance to mild exposure to the 
Shadow Curse
 Shadow Curse in the Shadow-Cursed Lands, though she will still need protection in areas where the curse is strongest.
Personal quest
Shadowheart's personal quest as companion is 
Daughter of Darkness
 Daughter of Darkness. As an origin her personal quest is 
Daughter of Darkness (Origin)
 Daughter of Darkness (Origin). Her personal quest is spanning all acts of the game. Throughout it, Shadowheart uncovers fragments of her shrouded history, re-examines her relationship with her goddess Shar and decides her own future: whether to remain in the dark embrace of the Lady of Loss or free herself from her past.

Three further subquests are available that tie into her personal quest: 
The Chosen of Shar
 The Chosen of Shar, in which Shadowheart's faith is tested, 
A Familiar Face
 A Familiar Face, where parts of her past come to light, and 
Surrender Shadowheart
 Surrender Shadowheart, in which the party considers a treacherous proposition.

Recruitment
Shadowheart can be recruited as a temporary companion during the Prologue on the Nautiloid by freeing her from the mind flayer pod; she can become a permanent companion during Act One.

Prologue
Shadowheart is first encountered on the Nautiloid during the Prologue, trapped inside a mind flayer pod. She can be freed by interacting with the nearby console or as a Barbarian, using one of the dialogue options below:
[BARBARIAN] Grip the pod's lid and pull.
[BERSERKER] [STRENGTH] RIP THE POD OPEN. (DC 10)
[BARBARIAN] [STRENGTH] Don't give up. Tear this thing open. (DC 10)
If she is freed, she joins the party as a temporary companion. Upon escaping the nautiloid, she leaves the party.
Act One
Shadowheart can be found a second time at the Ravaged Beach in the Wilderness. If freed from the pod during the Prologue, she is seen lying unconscious on the ground and wakes up if interacted with. If not freed, she is instead found attempting to gain entry to the nearby Dank Crypt. Either way, she can be invited to join the party after speaking with her.
If not spoken with at the Ravaged Beach, Shadowheart moves to the Druid Grove on her own searching for a healer; she can be spoken with there and invited to join the party.
If entering the Goblin Camp without recruiting Shadowheart, she shows up and saves the party from the Voice of the Absolute using the Mysterious Artefact. If not recruited, she may be convinced to wait there, or fought to the death.
If ignoring the Goblin Camp and walking towards the Mountain Pass, Shadowheart shows up there and saves the party from the Voice as they attempt to cross the bridge into the main area.
If ignoring both the Goblin Camp and the Mountain Pass, and entering the Underdark without her, Shadowheart ultimately appears there and saves the party from the Voice of the Absolute as they enter the elevator to the Shadow-Cursed Lands.
Leaving the party
If the player character makes clear they refuse to travel with a Sharran when she reveals her Shar worship, offers her to Viconia DeVir Viconia DeVir in exchange for Sharran aid in fighting the Absolute, or kills her parents after rescuing them in Act Three, she permanently leaves the party.

Approval
Main article: Shadowheart/Approval
Shadowheart ApprovesShadowheart prefers finding pragmatic and efficient solutions to problems. Accordingly, she appreciates discretion, creativity, and open-mindedness. She generally responds well to acts of heroism. While Shadowheart is afraid of wolves, she loves animals and will always react favourably to positive interactions with them and negatively to cruelty towards them. As a devout Sharran, Shadowheart also approves of acts against Selûne Selûne and Selûnites in general.
影心倾向于寻找务实高效的解决问题方式。因此她欣赏谨慎、创造力和开放思维。通常她对英雄主义行为反应积极。虽然影心惧怕狼群，但她热爱动物，总是对善待动物的行为表示赞许，对虐待行为则持反对态度。作为虔诚的莎尔信徒，影心也会赞许针对 Selûne 塞伦涅及其信徒的行为。
Shadowheart greatly values her privacy. She dislikes those who pry for details on her personal life, her faith or (should they learn of it) disapprove of her worship of Shar, as well as those who press for responses to questions she has already declined to answer. Shadowheart also has has a dry, witty,[2] cynical, and often biting sense of humor, which may soften somewhat towards the player character if she is romanced. She does not like needless cruelty or violence and can respond unfavourably to others being too open with untrustworthy or unknown individuals. Straying from Shar's mandates results in Shadowheart being punished through the wound in her right hand, a reminder to follow Shar Shar's wishes.

Romance
Main article: Shadowheart/Romance
After being given the Idol of Shar by the PC as a Selûnite cleric, and being challenged to "Kiss me like you hate me", Shadowheart teases the player character with the promise of a kiss as she slowly circles them from behind, kissing them a few times on their backside, before finally sharing a passionate kiss face-to-face.
A romanced Shadowheart teases a Selûnite player character with the promise of a kiss.
Shadowheart can be romanced by characters of any gender, and is one of the few characters willing to have a casual relationship. Throughout it, she will have to deal with the topic of her identity and how the idea of love fits the Sharran concept of self-sacrifice for their goddess. If romanced by a Selûnite cleric, Shadowheart has unique dialogue and behavior options available. [3]
影心可与任何性别的角色发展恋爱关系，也是少数愿意保持随性关系的角色之一。在这段关系中，她将不得不面对关于自我身份的议题，以及爱情观念如何与莎尔信徒为女神自我牺牲的教义相协调。若与塞伦涅牧师相恋，影心会触发独特的对话和行为选项 [3] 。
Nightsong points
Unlike other Companions, Shadowheart has a unique secondary approval system, influencing the choices in Find the Nightsong and Find Ketheric Thorm's Relic. For more information, see Nightsong Points.

Description
Appearance
Lithe of frame, well dressed and with meticulously managed features, Shadowheart is not unattractive [4][5] and may, if mentioning this to her (e.g. if romanced), acknowledge this matter-of-factly [6]. She has straight, coal-black hair and a long, flowing ponytail fastened in segments by elaborately crafted silver loops. Her fringe hair is kept short and straight, revealing her brows beneath and a scar running from her nose to her right cheek. Hair adorns her face on the sides, reaching past her chin, her pointed ears barely peeking through them, and her eyes, light-green with speckles of yellow, are contoured by dark make-up. Though rarely seen, she has a black circular mark on her right hand, a wound given by Shar, causing Shadowheart pain whenever she engages in behavior the Lady of Sorrows disapproves of. Though appearing youthful due to her elven heritage, she is over 40 years old.[7]

Shadowheart complements her Sharran attire with a silver circlet worn above her fringe. It is simple, yet elegant, displaying her goddess' holy symbol, a black disc, as well as an ornate argent hairpiece at the base of her ponytail, reminiscent of the decorations found in Sharran temples.

After the events of 
The Chosen of Shar
 The Chosen of Shar, if Shadowheart turns away from Shar, she will dye her hair silver and part her fringe off-center, showing more of her forehead. If she remains faithful, however, she will maintain her black hair but part it nonetheless.

Personality
Zealously devoted, independent and headstrong, Shadowheart prefers pragmatic solutions to problems, decisive action in the face of uncertainty and remaining uninvolved in the affairs of others. While she initially seems guarded and reserved – hesitant to reveal information about herself – she is in fact amnesiac, with little memory of her own past. Fiercely devoted to Shar, she does not tolerate slights against her goddess, often reacting defensively. Trained in the Sharran ways, she is also not above forceful, ruthless actions, duplicity or even killing in order to achieve her goals.

Still, Shadowheart displays traits that are often at odds with her Sharran training. She has a fondness for flowers and animals, disapproves of indiscriminate violence, prefers relatively peaceful resolutions to conflicts when possible and often sympathizes with the plights of party members. She can be as sarcastic as Astarion Astarion and does not shy away from dark humour. She is introspective and often harbours doubts as can be seen by romancing her, and when guided away from Shar, she is much more open and honest with her feelings.

History
Early life

A girl in the woods
Born to parents Arnell Hallowleaf Arnell and Emmeline Hallowleaf Emmeline Hallowleaf, Jenevelle, as she was named, was raised in a Selûnite household in the forests outside Baldur's Gate.[8] Devout followers of the Moonmaiden, they worshipped her in quiet seclusion away from the city, raising young Jenevelle in the ways of Selûne. In time, she would take part of an ancient Selûnite initiation rite: abandoned in the wilds, she would have to rely on her skills and faith to fend for herself, proving herself as a devout believer once she returned.[9]

Yet Shar Shar, Selûne's dark sister, had other plans for the child and commanded Viconia DeVir Viconia DeVir and a cadre of Sharrans to kidnap her.[10] Arnell had learned of this ploy after capturing a Sharran spy, and taking his wolf form, raced towards Jenevelle. But young Jenevelle never learned of her father's curse of lycanthropy, and instead of being rescued by her father, all she saw was a great wolf hunting her.[11] The Sharrans caught up to the pair and kidnapped both, taking them to a secret cloister of the Dark Lady in Baldur's Gate.

Life as a Sharran
Jenevelle would be brought to the Cloister of Sombre Embrace, a Sharran temple in Baldur's Gate set up and ran by Mother Superior Viconia DeVir after her previous endeavours in Waterdeep had failed.[12][13] Viconia's mission, given to her directly by Shar, was to mould young Jenevelle into a champion of the Dark Lady, an effort that would ultimately take almost half a century.[14] At first Jenevelle resisted the indoctrination, but the brutal training she would be put through, being lied to that her parents perished defending her from wolves, as well as repeated forced use of the temple's Mirror of Loss, would slowly erase her past and in time forge a new identity: Shadowheart.

The Mother Superior was especially cruel with Shadowheart, forcing her to use the Mirror of Loss more than any other acolyte. Under Viconia's watchful eye and no longer recognizing her parents, Shadowheart was forced to repeatedly torture and practice her newfound skills on them.[15] Still, Shadowheart was able to retain a few memories from her past thanks to Rennald, a young Tiefling acolyte undergoing similar training. Any time she would be subjected to mirror training, Rennald would do his best to remind Shadowheart who she was afterwards.[16] Thanks to him, and whatever scattered notes she was able to jot down between mirror trainings,[17] Shadowheart was able to retain some parts of her identity, such as her fondness for flowers and animals. The two became good friends, and one of the few blessings during her time in the cloister.

Hunting after the mysterious artefact
At some point during Shadowheart's last stages of training, whispers of the rise of a mysterious cult reached the Mother Superior's ears. This Cult of the Absolute as it was being called, was quickly gaining traction among the populace and threatened Sharran influence over the city.[18] As luck would have it, the Sharrans captured a Githyanki scout who,[19] after being subjected to merciless torture, revealed the existence of a githyanki artefact of immense power such that the cult became desperate to find, lest it be used against them.[20] Such an artefact could prove an asset for the Sharrans in thwarting the absolutist presence in the city, so the Mother Superior quickly formed a party of elite devouts, tasking them with its retrieval.[21] Though deemed a suicide mission, Shadowheart and four other companions set out to fulfil what they believed were Shar's commands.

The group was able to locate the Mysterious Artefact though at great cost: Shadowheart was the only survivor.[22]

Disaster would not stop there, however, as she soon found herself captive at the hands of Mind Flayers. How and where she was captured is never explored, however, and at some point during her capture she was tadpoled and imprisoned in a pod, awaiting  Ceremorphosis.

Involvement
Shadowheart Icon.png
See main article: Daughter of Darkness
Daughter of Darkness is Shadowheart's personal quest. It is added to the journal upon recruiting her and spans all three acts of the game.

Prologue
Shadowheart can be encountered during the battle aboard the Nautiloid. Trapped in a mind flayer pod, the party can decide whether to free her or not. If released, she joins the party as a temporary companion until they escape the ship.

As an origin character
As an origin character, Shadowheart wakes up in the pod where all player characters start. The artifact is on the floor nearby, and she is prompted to pick it up and bring it to Baldur's Gate. There is no one in the pod where Shadowheart is usually found.

On the Ravaged Beach, Shadowheart is the only one present. As a result, there are only two intellect devourers to fight, rather than the usual three, but it can be a significantly more difficult fight if other companions are not recruited first. The fight can be bypassed by climbing rocks on the right of the location where the intellect devourers are found. If returning later with at least two party members, then there will be three intellect devourers.

Act One
During the first act of the game, the mystery of the artefact Shadowheart carries is slowly uncovered, as well as the mission that led her to find it. Shadowheart eventually reveals she is a devout of Shar and her mission to deliver the artefact to her cloister in Baldur's Gate. She also reveals that, as part of the operation, she had her memories suppressed so she would not betray Shar, who exerts her influence over her through the wound in Shadowheart's hand.

On approaching the Mountain Pass the first time, the party can encounter Voss Kith'rak Voss, who informs them the githyanki are searching for an object very similar to Shadowheart's artefact. Whatever the outcome of this encounter, Lae'zel Lae'zel confronts Shadowheart about the artefact later in camp. As a result, Shadowheart judges Lae'zel a critical threat to her mission and attempts to kill her in her sleep the next long rest, though she can be convinced to desist and put grudges aside.

Shadowheart may also slowly reveal parts of her past. Upon an encounter with wolves, if asked about her apparent fear of them, she may, depending on player approval, show a memory of a young Shadowheart being saved from a wolf attack by Sharrans. Similarly, if given the Noblestalk from the Underdark, Shadowheart remembers a young tiefling named Rennald, who she was friends with during her initiate years. This adds the quest 
A Familiar Face
 A Familiar Face to the journal.

Should the party learn about Dark Justiciars, Shadowheart, if asked more about them, states that they are elite warriors of Shar and that she dreams of becoming one some day. This adds the quest 
The Chosen of Shar

Act Two

Upon first arriving in the Shadow-Cursed Lands the next conversation with Shadowheart has her comment on how the 
Shadow Curse
 Shadow Curse does not seem to affect her as much as others and that she must be blessed by Shar. She can be challenged or supported about this and, regardless of how she is approached, comments on how this protection must have been granted for a reason and that she needs to be on the lookout for any place dedicated to Shar.

Having high approval with Shadowheart lets her at some point reveal that one of her favourite flowers is the Night Orchid. One such flower can be found in the Ruined Battlefield in the Shadow-Cursed Lands and given to her. If given, Shadowheart expresses her gratitude and laments not having anything to give in return.

Within the Grand Mausoleum the party finds the Gauntlet of Shar, ancient proving grounds for Dark Justiciar aspirants. Shadowheart expresses excitement about the possibility of proving herself to her goddess, and urges the party to complete the trials and allow her to become a Dark Justiciar. Completing the trials leads the party to the Shadowfell and the confrontation with the Aylin Nightsong. Shadowheart's fate greatly diverges depending on the choices made here.

If allowed to slay the Nightsong, Shar is greatly pleased with Shadowheart, and finally names her Dark Justiciar, granting her powerful rewards. Shadowheart is elated she has finally achieved her dream, and vows to serve Shar faithfully until death.

Alternatively, Shadowheart can be convinced to spare the Nightsong, abandoning Shar to forge her own future. In doing so, the Nightsong is freed and Shadowheart is abandoned by her goddess for good.

Finally, if choosing to not bring Shadowheart to the Shadowfell or surrendering the Nightsong to Balthazar Balthazar, Shadowheart becomes furious and either attacks or permanently leaves the party. Any of these outcomes completes 
The Chosen of Shar

Act Three
Portrait Mother Superior.png
“
Loss is a gift, girl. Do you still not understand that?
„
— Mother Superior to Shadowheart
If remaining in the party, whether commanded by Shar as a Dark Justiciar, or guided by Aylin Aylin, Shadowheart's next destination is the Cloister of Sombre Embrace in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. A Dark Justiciar Shadowheart is commanded by Shar to cleanse the cloister from corruption, while a Shadowheart who freed Aylin and turned against Shar is spurred by the hope she may find her parents alive there.   

There, Shadowheart encounters Viconia DeVir Viconia DeVir, the cloister's Mother Superior and the person who saw to her training as an initiate. Viconia demands the mysterious artefact and the surrender of Shadowheart. Once more, Shadowheart's fate can go different ways depending on choices made. The party may agree to surrender Shadowheart to Viconia, losing her as a companion but gaining the Sharrans as allies for the final battle. Hearing Viconia's offer out begins the subquest 
Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia
 Surrender Shadowheart to Viconia. Alternatively, the party can confront Viconia and the Sharrans, resulting in their demise. If surrendered to Viconia, the main quest (and corresponding subquest) is completed.   

While exploring the cloister, the party may run into Nocturne Nocturne, a tiefling who recognises Shadowheart. If Shadowheart recovered some of her memories by eating noblestalk, she realises Nocturne is the young tiefling friend from her past, even though she has changed since then. Shadowheart and Nocturne then reminisce about growing up in the cloister. This encounter completes 
A Familiar Face

探索修道院时，队伍可能遇见 Nocturne 夜曲，一位认出影心的提夫林。若影心曾通过食用高贵菇恢复部分记忆，她会认出夜曲正是自己年少时的提夫林玩伴，尽管对方容貌已变。二人随后共同追忆在修道院长大的往事。此遭遇将完成 A Familiar Face 似曾相识任务。

If Viconia is refused and defeated, the party may enter the Threshold of Loss, Shar's hidden sanctum. There, Shadowheart comes face to face with her parents, long thought dead. Shar's ultimate test for a Dark Justiciar requires her to slay them. In doing so, Shar blesses Shadowheart, wiping her memory and tasking her with rebuilding the cloister. Shar's faithful become available as

If she abandoned Shar, Shadowheart has a difficult choice to make: save her parents but be forever bound to Shar's curse, or sacrifice her parents and sever the curse at last. Either choice completes 
Daughter of Darkness
 Daughter of Darkness.
如果影心背弃莎尔，她将面临艰难抉择：拯救父母但永远受困于莎尔的诅咒，或是牺牲双亲最终斩断诅咒。无论选择哪条路，都将完成 Daughter of Darkness 黑暗之女任务线。

During the party's next long rest, Shadowheart is found waiting for the player character at a statue of Selûne.
在队伍下一次长休时，影心会在塞伦涅的雕像旁等候玩家角色。

If turned from Shar in Act Two or saving her parents as a Dark Justiciar, she reflects on her feelings now that she truly knows who she is. If her parents are alive, she worries they will not be able to look her in the eye after the tortures she put them through. She breaks down crying for a while, possibly in the arms of the player character (if they select "Embrace her") and/or her parents (if they are alive), before she ultimately decides to keep and reclaim the name Shadowheart for herself, stating, "You can't cast a shadow without some light." If Shadowheart as an origin character saved her parents, her mother, Emmeline Hallowleaf Emmeline Hallowleaf, says this line instead in support of reclaiming her new name.
若在第二章放弃莎尔信仰或作为暗夜法官救下双亲，她会因真正认清自我而反思内心感受。若双亲健在，她担心他们无法直视曾施加酷刑的自己。她会崩溃痛哭——可能依偎在玩家角色怀中（若选择"拥抱她"）和/或父母怀里（若双亲存活）——最终决定保留并重拾"影心"之名，宣称"无光之处，阴影不生"。若作为起源角色的影心救下双亲，其母 Emmeline Hallowleaf 艾梅琳·空叶将代为说出这句支持她重获新名的台词。

Otherwise, if Shadowheart remained a Dark Justiciar, overthrew Viconia and killed her parents, she instead mocks Selûne and vandalizes the statue, covering it in Aylin's blood.
若影心保持暗夜法官身份，推翻维康妮亚并杀死双亲，她会转而嘲弄塞伦涅并损毁神像，将艾琳的鲜血涂抹其上。

Endings
结局[编辑 | 编辑源代码]
Adventures throughout the Sword Coast
剑湾冒险之旅
If Shadowheart turned from Shar and lost her parents in the process, she embarks on adventures throughout the  Sword Coast, visiting the  House of the Moon in Waterdeep, battling Sharran assassins and even befriending an Imp named Bing Bong.[23] [24] Though she travels alone (unless romanced), Shadowheart appears to be happy with her new life; she also says that she still feels the presence of her parents in their moonmotes and looks forward to reuniting with them when she dies.
如果影心背离莎尔并在此过程中失去双亲，她会踏上  剑湾各地的冒险之旅，造访深水城的  月之屋，对抗莎尔教派的刺客，甚至与一只名为宾邦的小魔鬼成为朋友。 [23] [24] 尽管独自旅行（除非建立恋爱关系），影心似乎对新生活感到满足；她还表示仍能在月尘中感受到父母的存在，并期待死后与他们重逢。

Life at a country farmstead
乡村农庄生活
If she turned from Shar and rescued her parents, Shadowheart moves to a country farmstead to live surrounded by flowers, pets[25] and family. There, she is finally able to live the life she wanted, surrounded by love. If romanced, the player character lives with her and her family, a quiet life after adventures. From time to time Shar inflicts pain on Shadowheart through the wound on her hand but, now at peace and surrounded by those she loves, she no longer minds and notices those events becoming more infrequent as of late.
若她背弃莎尔并救出父母，影心会搬往乡间农庄，生活在鲜花、宠物 [25] 与家人的环绕中。她终于得以在爱的包围下过上向往的生活。若与玩家相恋，主角将与她及其家人共同生活，在冒险后享受宁静时光。莎尔偶尔会通过她手上的伤疤施加痛苦，但如今心境平和且被所爱之人环绕的影心已不再在意，并注意到这类事件正日渐减少。

Mother Superior of the Sharran cloister
莎尔修道院院长
If Shadowheart chooses to remain in Shar's embrace, she becomes the new Mother Superior of the Sharran cloister in Baldur's Gate, operating from the House of Grief. In the months since, word of the Lady of Loss has spread far and wide, thanks to the efforts of Shadowheart. If romanced, Shadowheart ends the relationship prior to this, explaining that she needs to be fully devoted to her goddess. She agrees to be kissed for old times' sake, but remains faithful to Shar. Shadowheart also expresses sympathy for Viconia's fate, now able to understand what she went through as Mother Superior.
若影心选择继续侍奉莎尔，她将成为博德之门莎尔修道院的新任院长，以悲恸之家为据点活动。数月之间，在影心的努力下，"失落女士"的威名远播四方。若此前与玩家建立恋爱关系，影心会在此前结束这段感情，解释说自己必须完全献身于女神。她同意为旧日情谊献上一吻，但始终忠于莎尔。影心对维康妮亚的结局表示同情，如今她已能理解这位前院长曾经的处境。

查看重新设计的影心内容
Shadowheart had at some point in development a vastly different backstory and storyline that was completely revamped prior to the game's release. This previous version of Shadowheart once had a high elven mother named Eliriana, a human father named Sebastian, had been acquainted with a Mother Superior (different from Viconia DeVir Viconia DeVir), a Sister Superior, as well as a Sharran torturer.
影心在开发过程中曾拥有完全不同的背景故事与剧情线，这些内容在游戏正式发布前被彻底重构。旧版设定中的影心有位高等精灵母亲名为艾莉瑞安娜，人类父亲名为塞巴斯蒂安，并与一位女院长（不同于 Viconia DeVir 维康妮亚·德维尔）、修女长以及一名莎尔信徒拷问者存在关联。

Notes and References
注释与参考文献[编辑 | 编辑源代码]
 In the Early Access version her background was Urchin.
↑ 在抢先体验版本中，她的背景设定曾是"街头孤儿"。
 In Act Two, in the foyer of Moonrise Towers, just east of the stairs leading from the main door, is a ladder which can be used to access the rafters. In the rafters, just to the east of the ladder is a cracked wall. Interacting with the wall allows a player character to reach in, causing a tentacle to grab their arm and pull them in unless they pass a check. If passed, Shadowheart remarks in double entendre, "Careful, in future - you can't just stick your hand in every strange hole you come across."
↑ 在第二章中，月出之塔门厅的主楼梯东侧有一架可通往椽架的梯子。椽架区域梯子东侧有面裂开的墙。与之互动会让玩家角色伸手探查，若未通过检定就会被触须抓住手臂拖入墙内。若通过检定，影心会一语双关地调侃道："以后小心点——可不能见着个奇怪的洞就把手伸进去。"
 After being given the Idol of Shar by the player character as a Selûnite cleric, and being challenged to "Kiss me like you hate me", one of Shadowheart's possible responses includes teasing the player character with the promise of a kiss as she slowly circles them from behind, kissing them a few times on their backside, before finally sharing a passionate kiss face-to-face.
↑ 当玩家角色以塞伦涅牧师身份将  莎尔神像交给影心，并挑衅地说"像恨我一样吻我"时，影心可能的回应之一是从背后缓缓绕行戏弄玩家角色，承诺给予亲吻，先在对方臀部轻吻几下，最终才面对面分享一个激情热吻。
 In some conversations at camp, companions such as Astarion Astarion may comment on Shadowheart's appearance and desire for physical contact with her, or express their agreement if the player character says they feel the same.
↑ 在营地的某些对话中，诸如 Astarion 阿斯代伦等同伴可能会对影心的外貌发表评论，表达与她肢体接触的渴望，或者当玩家角色表示有相同感受时表示赞同。
 If romancing Shadowheart during Act Two, Withers Withers may, if spoken to by the player character, start the exchange by observing, "Thou hast now a bosom-companion. Take care that thou art not distracted on thy quest, seeking the comforts of the flesh.", to which they may respond: "You mean Shadowheart...? Gods, I wish she were my 'bosom-companion'."
↑ 若在第二章与影心发展浪漫关系时， Withers 若玩家角色与枯萎者对话，他可能会以这样的观察开场："汝今有红颜知己。当心莫因贪恋肉体欢愉而分心求索之道。"对此玩家可回应："你是指影心...？天啊，我倒希望她真是我的'红颜知己'。"
 Near the conclusion of the player character's first night of romance with Shadowheart, while they are laying down, the player character can select the option, Look into her eyes, prompting her to ask somewhat annoyedly, "What?" If answering with, "You're beautiful." Shadowheart replies non-nonchalantly, "I know. But you're sweet to notice."
↑ 在玩家角色与影心初次浪漫之夜临近结束时，两人躺卧之际，玩家可选择"凝视她的眼眸"选项，这会让她略带恼意地问道："干嘛？"若回答"你真美"，影心会漫不经心地回应："我知道。不过你能注意到，还挺贴心的。"
 Cloister of Sombre Embrace, ambient line spoken by Shadowheart upon reading No Price Too High in the dormitory.
↑ 阴郁拥抱修道院，影心在宿舍阅读《  代价再高亦无妨》时所说的环境台词。
"These are all about me... forty years of my life, documented like I was some sort of specimen."
"这些全是我...四十载人生，被记录得像个实验标本似的。"
 Multiple things point to Shadowheart having grown up in Moonhaven, the former name for the now ruined Blighted Village, such as her reaction when picking up the Old Schoolbook or her scene at the Selûnite statue behind the mill. However, it is difficult to confirm as different sources in-game indicate that the village was destroyed over a hundred years ago by Ketheric Thorm's dark justiciar army, and Shadowheart is estimated to be roughly fifty years old. Conflicting timelines regarding the village and its destruction do not line up, thus, it is possible the intent during development was that she and her family had indeed lived in Moonhaven, but the inconsistencies were never properly fixed for release. Her main writer, John Corcoran, has stated she grew up in Moonhaven.
↑ 多个线索表明影心曾在月溪镇（现已成为废墟的凋零之村旧称）长大，比如她拾取  老旧课本时的反应，或在磨坊后塞伦涅雕像前的场景。但难以确证的是，游戏内不同资料显示该村庄在一百多年前就被凯瑟里克·索姆的暗夜法官军队摧毁，而影心年龄估算约五十岁。关于村庄及其毁灭时间线的矛盾无法吻合，因此可能开发时的设定意图确实是她与家人曾居住于月溪镇，但这些不一致之处在发布前未得到妥善修正。她的主笔编剧约翰·科克兰已声明影心在月溪镇长大。
 Campsite, line spoken by Arnell Hallowleaf Arnell Hallowleaf if saved from Shar and asked about what happened the night of the abduction.
↑ 营地对话，由 Arnell Hallowleaf 阿内尔·霍洛叶夫（若从莎尔手中救出并询问绑架当晚情况时）说出
"You were to come of age that night - left alone in the woods, and only using Selûne's guidance to find your way back to us."
"那晚本是你成年礼——独自留在森林中，仅凭塞伦涅的指引寻路回到我们身边。"

 In Service of the Night by Viconia DeVir
↑  源自维康妮亚·德维尔所著《暗夜侍奉》
 Campsite, lines spoken by Arnell Hallowleaf if saved from Shar and asked about what happened the night of the abduction.
↑ 营地对话，若从莎尔手中救出阿内尔·霍洛叶夫后询问绑架当晚情形时的台词。
"We caught a Sharran spy near our village, and learned that his accomplices sought to abduct you. (...) I took on my wolf-form to cover the ground more quickly. (...) But when I found you, you did not see your father rushing to save you - you only saw a wolf, hunting you in the darkness."
"我们在村庄附近抓到一个莎尔间谍，得知他的同伙正计划绑架你。(...)我化为狼形以便更快地追踪。(...)但当我找到你时，你看到的不是赶来救你的父亲——只看见一头在黑暗中追猎你的狼。"

"They had you use us for... practice. All the techniques that the Sharrans hold pride in. Trickery, interrogation... torture. They even had you, our own daughter, try to convert us."
"他们让你把我们当作...练习对象。所有令莎尔信徒引以为豪的手段。欺骗、审问...酷刑。他们甚至让你——我们亲生的女儿——试图转化我们。"

"耳语从四面八方传来——莎尔女士的潜在敌手们，都在争夺同一个目标。一个新神，正聚集着心怀不满者、被放逐者——那些本该投奔我们的人。(...)我必须行动。必须趁这肮脏阴谋尚在襁褓时就将其扼杀。"
