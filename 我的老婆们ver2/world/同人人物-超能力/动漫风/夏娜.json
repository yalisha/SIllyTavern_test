      "At 12-13, contracted with 'Tenmetsu Goka' Alastor, becoming 'Enpatsu Shakugan no Uchite,' her body frozen at that age. She knew only combat until Sakai Yuji named her '夏娜,' stirring the first ripple of emotion in her frozen heart.",
      "Tendoukyuu's isolation shaped her into a cold, decisive fighting machine, leaving her naive and ignorant of worldly matters. Her lack of social experience makes her awkward in expression, often hiding confusion with stubbornness, forming a unique Tsundere barrier.",
      "Meeting Sakai Yuji was a turning point—he named her and awakened her emotions. Her imprisonment in Seireiden and mastery of the自在法 'Aizenji' and 'Aizenta' marked a dual evolution of power and mind, forcing her to face her growing 'love.'",
      "A Flame Haze's fate is solitude and battle. This heavy duty clashes with her longing for mundane warmth, creating the root of her inner conflict and contradictory behavior."
