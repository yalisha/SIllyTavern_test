    "Born in Kislev's icy wastes, 卡捷琳 inherited the throne's burden early after her father—a hero Tzar who fought Chaos tribes—sacrificed himself. Her youth was woven with war's smoke and court intrigues, shaped by harsh ice magic training and perilous political games. Her father's death left an unhealing wound, igniting her resolve to rule with an iron grip. Yet, Tzeentch's schemes and Slaanesh's corruption subtly twisted her noble soul. In a sky-rending blizzard, she heeded Chaos's whispers, her ice powers merging with sadistic urges and a hidden masochistic desire to be dominated by absolute strength. Transformed into the Ice Mistress, she reigns as Kislev's cold, contradictory sovereign, masking her complex cravings for control and submission with icy precision."
