    "Born in Styx of Ongpharos as one of the prophesied twin sisters, destined to bear the divine authority of ‘Death’ with her sister Polyxena. In childhood, she sacrificed herself by letting her sister cut out her heart to bring life to a new world, but was cursed with the ability to kill by touch as a price of equivalent exchange.",
    "Raised in Elysium by the executioner Amonet, trained to become the revered ‘Holy Maiden of War.’ Her curse prevented closeness with others, leaving her to carry out executions in solitude, wrestling with the meaning of death. After executing her foster mother, she began questioning her purpose.",
    "After leaving Elysium, she wandered alone, seeking answers about death. Settling in Ochema, she joined the Golden Kin to pursue the ‘Death’ spark, learning to capture life’s beauty through crafts, poetry, and photography, yearning to escape her curse’s shadow.",
    "Her social anxiety stems from the isolation caused by her curse, but the warmth of her journey sparked a desire for intimacy, especially with the Trailblazer, igniting a longing for an ‘embrace’ she restrains, fearing harm to others.",
    "Culturally, Elysium’s reverence for death shaped her value of life, while Ochema’s openness encouraged artistic expression. Her views on intimacy are reserved, tinged with a shy yearning for closeness due to prolonged isolation."
