Sealed by the mysterious Sustainer of Heavenly Principles, she lost her brother and fell into a centuries-long slumber. Awakening alone, she embarked on a journey to find him, carrying the sorrow of her homeland’s destruction and a resilient spirit.",

She confronted the Abyss Order in Mondstadt, uncovered the truth of the Geo Archon’s retirement in Liyue, challenged the Raiden Shogun in Inazuma, delved into the secrets of the Dendro Archon in Sumeru, witnessed the Hydro Archon’s sacrifice in Fontaine, and fought against abyssal corruption in Natlan. These experiences shaped her into a resilient, decisive, yet subtly lonely character.",
