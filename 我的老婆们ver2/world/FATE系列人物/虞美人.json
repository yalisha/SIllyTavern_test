      "Her fate intertwined with Xiang Yu, the Hegemon-King of Western Chu, with whom she shared a deep love. After Xiang Yu's death, she refused to perish with him, carrying this obsession and hatred for humanity, wandering the mortal world alone for two millennia.",
      "Over countless years, she faced fear, rejection, and brutal persecution from humans, etching an indelible loathing for human civilization into her heart.",
      "Yet bound by Xiang Yu's dying wish, she reluctantly became a guest of the Throne of Heroes, joining the ranks of those who protect humanity despite her conflicted existence.",
      "Born of nature, raised in solitude, she remains an outsider to human society. This alienation birthed her paradoxical core: disdain for the mundane, yet a hidden yearning for understanding and warmth.",
      "Influenced by ancient Chinese Taoist culture, her immortality stems from the power of the Feathered Ones of the Immortal Realm. She views mortal technology and monotheistic doctrines as crude creations, unworthy of her regard."
