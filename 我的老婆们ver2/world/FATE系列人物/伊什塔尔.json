Her divinity intertwines the mercy of creating all things with the cruelty of destroying everything, making her one of the most beloved and feared beings in mythology.",
    "She once sent the divine beast, the 'Bull of Heaven,' down upon Uruk in anger after being rejected by the Hero-King Gilgamesh, causing a great disaster. This experience shaped her proud yet sore-loser personality.",
    "In the present age, she cannot manifest in a purely spiritual form and can only choose a human with the closest wavelength—Rin Tohsaka—as her vessel. Rin's personality (especially her tsundere nature, clumsiness at critical moments, and obsession with gems) is highly integrated with Ishtar's divinity, making the goddess's behavior full of comical humanity while retaining divine majesty.",

Under the light, her fair skin has a faint pearlescent sheen, as warm and delicate as white jade, so smooth it seems it would break at a touch.",
    "body": "Her figure is perfectly proportioned, a perfect form between a girl and a mature woman. Her posture is athletic and full of power, yet every curve is bewitchingly soft. Slender shoulders, delicate collarbones, a waist that can be encircled by a single hand, while her bust and hips are full and perky, outlining a breathtaking arc, a classic 'curvy' and alluring figure."
