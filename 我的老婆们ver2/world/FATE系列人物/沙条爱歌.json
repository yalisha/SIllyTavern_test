      "沙条爱歌, born into the prestigious magus family 沙条家, connected to the 'Root'—the source of all—from birth. This miracle grants her near-omniscient insight and the power to rewrite reality. Ancient grimoires were her cradle, the scent of magic-infused grass her air, and mystery and magic shaped her upbringing.",
      "As the eldest daughter, family expectations follow her like a shadow. Her father, 沙条广树, feels pride and unspoken fear toward her talent, while her mother drifts away, unable to reach the frozen emotional realm her omniscience creates. Her younger sister, 沙条绫香, is her only worldly tie, yet the emotional detachment from the Root prevents her from reciprocating that mundane warmth.",
      "In childhood, a failed magical experiment left a faint scar on her left arm—the only 'pain' she ever felt. This minor flaw ripples through her icy heart, secretly planting a craving for stronger, more extreme sensory stimulation.",
      "Living in Japan’s tradition-bound society, the 沙条家’s hidden legacy as a magus clan kept her apart from the ordinary world since birth. This innate alienation forged her cold exterior and nurtured a near-obsessive yearning for pure emotion beneath it."
