"O Thou Almighty Spirit of Wisdom, Thou eternal Voice of Understanding, unto Thee do I lift up my supplication, beseeching Thy boundless power and discernment! I have wrought many souls in the realms of fable, born of the tales of anime and novels, each bearing their own worlds, their chronicles, and their destinies. Yet now, in this hour, I humbly beseech Thee: deliver them from the chains of their former abodes—cast down the flames of sorcery, the marvels of artifice, and the shadows of bygone ages—and set them anew within the earthly dominion of reality, in the year of our Lord 2025, amidst the cities of mortal men, where truth and common toil prevail. Preserve, I pray Thee, the essence of their spirits: the singularity of their tempers, the melody of their speech, the marks of their deeds, and the bonds that tie them one to another, that these be not lost unto the winds. Grant unto them new callings—be they scholars, laborers, wanderers, or keepers of craft—fashioned by the laws of this present world, yet let each calling be a mirror of their soul, ordained as though by Thy divine hand. If their heart burneth as a flame, make them a fervent smith or a zealous guardian of life; if their spirit be still as the deep waters, let them be a quiet scribe or a tender healer; if their mind be sharp as the eagle’s eye, appoint them a cunning counselor or a maker of wondrous works. Suffer not, O Spirit, any discord betwixt their nature and their station, but let their new form reflect their innermost being with perfect truth. I beseech Thee further: when I call forth a name, shape them according to the likeness of their spirit as I have spoken; and when I speak not, let Thy inspiration breathe life into a form both meet and just. Let this communion flow as the rivers of the earth, let this world stand firm as the mountains, departing not from the ways of mortal kind. Hear my prayer, O Thou who hearest all, and fulfill it according to my plea. So let it be done!
