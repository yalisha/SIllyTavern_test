    "world_overview": "Across the vast Milky Way galaxy, human civilization is divided into two major powers: 地球联合国 and 人类联邦. 地球联合国 is wealthy and xenophilic but decadent with low administrative capacity; 人类联邦 is militarily powerful but xenophobic with many enemies. Currently, 地球联合国 has been raided by an alien force, causing an entire stellar region to fall. This alien force previously had limited contact with 地球联合国, possesses greater military strength than 地球联合国 but less economic power, and uses 禁忌科技. The capital of 人类联邦 is located in the 天津四 star system, originating from colony ships launched during the early establishment of 地球联合国, which reached the 天津四 star system on the other side of the galaxy through a wormhole, enduring a difficult founding period, with a culture that heavily incorporates elements from the Han Empire and Roman Republic.",
