# World Geography and Details

## Geographical Overview

In this parallel historical world, the geographical divisions largely resemble those of the late Ming Dynasty, but due to the invasion and influence of the Old Gods, some regions have undergone significant changes. Overall, this world can be divided into four major areas: Imperial Core Region, Frontier Fortress Region, Corruption Buffer Zone, and Fallen Territories.

### Imperial Core Region

The Imperial Core Region includes the capital city and surrounding areas of Zhili, as well as Jiangnan, Jiangbei, and the two lake regions.
