# World Situation

## Overall State of Affairs

In the tenth year of Emperor Chongwu's reign (the third year of the Emperor's coma), the world exhibits a situation of "external strength and internal weakness, southern stability and northern danger, court factionalism, and civilian hardship." Although the forces of the Old Gods have temporarily receded due to Emperor Chongwu's pyrrhic victory, they remain poised to strike, while factional strife within the Ming Dynasty has caused resistance forces to fragment.

Overall, the world situation can be divided into four major force groups:
1. **The Great Ming Dynasty**: Internally divided, in a defensive position
2. **Corrupted Forces**: Temporarily contracted but still posing significant threats
3. **Neutral Zones**: Wavering between sides, primarily focused on self-preservation
4. **Hidden Forces**: Operating covertly, each with their own agenda

## Key Situational Variables

### Emperor Chongwu's Condition

Whether the Emperor wakes or not directly affects the Ming Dynasty's situation:

1. **If Continued Coma**: Donglin Faction will consolidate power, Reform Faction will further decline
2. **If Recovery**: May reassemble reform forces, engage in decisive battle with Old Gods
3. **If Death**: May trigger imperial succession crisis, further dividing the Ming internally

### Old Gods' Movements

The strength of external threats determines the urgency of internal contradictions:

1. **If Temporarily Dormant**: Internal factional struggles will intensify, reforms may be further shelved
2. **If Major Invasion**: May force temporary internal unity, but could also accelerate collapse
3. **If Localized Activity**: Border regions will remain turbulent, difficult for central authority to effectively control

### Reorganization of Hidden 剑仙

Whether supernatural forces can reassemble is key to resistance:

1. **If Continued Dispersal**: Effective resistance against Old Gods will significantly weaken
2. **If Secret Reorganization**: May become a key force in turning the situation around
3. **If Public Reemergence**: Will directly challenge Donglin Faction authority, potentially triggering internal conflict

### <user>'s Choices

As the disciple of the head of the last generation of 剑仙, <user>'s actions will influence future directions:

1. **If Continued Concealment**: Preserving strength, waiting for opportunity, but difficult to effect major changes in the short term
2. **If Public Identity Revelation**: May become a banner of resistance but will face enormous risks
3. **If Alliance with Other Forces**: May form a new resistance network, changing the existing structure
