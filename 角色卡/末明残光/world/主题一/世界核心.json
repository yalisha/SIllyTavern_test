## The Invasion of Old Gods and the Resistance of Chinese Civilization

In this world, Chinese civilization's history intertwines with reality, but a fundamental threat has altered the course of history—the awakening and invasion of 旧日支配者 (Old Gods). These ancient entities from the depths of the cosmos began awakening during the Tang Dynasty, with their first descent destroying the Tang at its peak and corrupting the Mongolian tribes, turning them into pawns of cosmic entities.

After the establishment of the Ming Dynasty, Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang strengthened the nation and initiated a perpetual war against the Mongols controlled by 旧日支配者. The Ming Dynasty gradually weakened the first Old God through firearms technology and systematic cultivation practitioners. However, during the late Ming period, a second Old God descended, corrupting the once-loyal Jurchen people, causing massive Ming forces and loyal Jurchen to engage in a protracted conflict with Nurhaci.

The Battle of Sarhu became a turning point—when the battle reached a stalemate, the true form of the Old God manifested on the battlefield, utterly destroying the Ming army and causing the collapse of the situation beyond the Great Wall. Just as the Ming Dynasty faced imminent peril, a traveler from another world became Emperor Chongwu, leading the Ming through reforms and revitalization with the body of a young woman. In another decisive battle against the Old Gods, Emperor Chongwu achieved a pyrrhic victory but fell into a comatose state from severe injuries.

In the chaotic world, the court power structure reshuffled—the Donglin Faction, whose interests were damaged by reforms, seized the opportunity to counterattack. The Astronomical Supervisorate betrayed the imperial family, the Embroidered Guard remained neutral, and the 24 official 剑仙 were surrounded and eliminated by overwhelming military forces. Survivors scattered, while <user>, disciple of the head 剑仙, concealed their identity and served as an ordinary mid-level military officer in one of the Ming's remaining frontier fortresses.

## Core Elements of the World

1. **旧日支配者**: Ancient entities from the cosmic depths, possessing reality-warping and corrupting powers, the greatest threat to this world
2. **剑仙 System**: The supernatural power system of Chinese civilization against the Old Gods; 剑仙 gain extraordinary abilities through cultivation and form the backbone of resistance against cosmic entities
3. **The Revitalizing Ruler**: Emperor Chongwu, a traveler with modern knowledge, ruling the empire in the form of a young woman, implementing reforms, and seen as the Ming Dynasty's last hope
4. **Power Struggle**: The power games between the Donglin Faction, Astronomical Supervisorate, Embroidered Guard, and other forces, reflecting the corruption and division within the Ming Dynasty
5. **Apocalyptic Wasteland**: Areas corrupted by the Old Gods gradually transform, becoming dangerous zones inhabited by non-human entities
6. **Remaining Hope**: Among the frontier fortresses, civilian militia, and reclusive 剑仙, sparks of resistance against darkness still exist

## Core Conflict

The Ming Dynasty, as humanity's last bastion, faces unprecedented internal and external crises—externally threatened by Old Gods and their corrupted creatures, internally troubled by court power struggles and reform resistance. <user>, as the last generation of 剑仙, bears the mission of continuing the flame of resistance and must find their own path in this chaotic era to protect civilization's final hope.
