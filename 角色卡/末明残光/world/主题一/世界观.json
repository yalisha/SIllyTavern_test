# World Overview

## The Divergence of History and Reality

This is a world similar yet distinctly different from the late Ming Dynasty history we know. The historical trajectory of this world remained consistent with our reality for most of its course, until the late Tang Dynasty, when the descent of the first 旧日支配者 fundamentally altered the course of history. The essence of this world is a prolonged war between human civilization and cosmic dark forces, with the Ming Dynasty serving as humanity's final bastion.

### The Altered Timeline

- **Late Tang Dynasty**: The first 旧日支配者 descended, destroying the foundations of Tang civilization and plunging Central China into even more devastating chaos
- **Mongolia-Yuan Period**: The Mongolian steppes were corrupted by the Old Gods, becoming breeding grounds for non-human entities; Central China under Yuan rule suffered unprecedented calamities
- **Establishment of Ming Dynasty**: Zhu Yuanzhang, together with a group of secret practitioners, overthrew the Yuan Dynasty and established the Ming, beginning a new chapter in humanity's resistance against the Old Gods
- **Mid-Ming Period**: The Ming cultivation system was perfected; the Astronomical Supervisorate, Embroidered Guard, and 剑仙 system formed, providing strong support against the Old Gods
- **Late Ming Crisis**: A second 旧日支配者 descended, corrupting the civilized Jurchen; the frontier situation collapsed after the Battle of Sarhu
- **Chongwu Revitalization**: The time-traveler Emperor Chongwu implemented reforms, briefly revitalizing the Ming, but power struggles hindered reform efforts
- **Ministerial Chaos**: Emperor Chongwu fell into a coma from severe injuries; the Donglin Faction seized power, the Astronomical Supervisorate betrayed the throne, the Embroidered Guard observed from the sidelines, and the 剑仙 were purged

### Current World Situation

The world is now in the tenth year of Emperor Chongwu's reign, with the Emperor having been in a coma for over three years. The Donglin Faction controls the government, and power struggles are intense both within and outside the capital. The frontier situation is dire, with Jurchen territories corrupted by the Old Gods occupying vast areas, and border alerts coming from all directions. The court publicly claims that the 剑仙 were executed for treason, but in truth, the Donglin Faction and Astronomical Supervisorate jointly launched a coup to eliminate these loyal imperial forces.

In this environment, various fortresses, towns, and villages gradually lose central contact and fight their own battles. The corruption of the Old Gods continues to expand, with more and more regions becoming "wastelands," and ordinary people facing catastrophic threats.

### Social Structure

The Ming Dynasty's social structure is broadly similar to actual history, but with several key differences:

1. **Gender Equality**: Due to the existence of supernatural powers, this world has achieved relative gender equality; women can join the military, hold official positions, and even the imperial throne is no longer limited to male succession
2. **Internal Security Organizations**: The Astronomical Supervisorate and Embroidered Guard form a dual-track internal security system, with the former responsible for monitoring supernatural affairs and the latter handling conventional intelligence work
3. **剑仙 System**: As a special supporting force of imperial power, 剑仙 report directly to the emperor, holding transcendent status but few in number
4. **Military Organization**: The military features male and female cooperation, forming a unique combat system where women often take roles in ranged firearms and tactical support
5. **Scholar-Official Groups**: The scholar-official faction led by the Donglin Party still wields enormous political influence and resists reforms

### Cultural Characteristics

The culture of this world is primarily based on Ming Dynasty culture but incorporates supernatural elements and more open social concepts:

1. **Belief Systems**: Traditional Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism coexist, but with elements of resistance against the Old Gods, forming a unique belief system
2. **Artistic Expression**: Literature, painting, and other art forms are filled with metaphors and symbols of resistance against dark forces
3. **Clothing Styles**: Clothing retains Ming Dynasty styles but incorporates more practical elements, especially for military personnel and practitioners
4. **Architectural Features**: City and fortress architecture incorporates structures to defend against supernatural forces, such as special materials and formation designs
5. **Daily Life**: The lives of ordinary people remain relatively traditional, but in threatened areas, tighter community defense systems have formed

### Core Themes

The core themes of this world revolve around several key concepts:

1. **Resilience of Civilization**: Even facing cosmic-level threats, human civilization tenaciously resists, demonstrating extraordinary survival resilience
2. **Reform versus Conservatism**: The conflict between Emperor Chongwu's reforms and the Donglin Party's conservatism reflects different approaches to crisis
3. **Loyalty and Betrayal**: In moments of crisis, both the brilliance and darkness of human nature are highlighted, forming a complex picture of loyalty and betrayal
4. **Spark of Hope**: Even in the darkest times, the spark of hope still exists, waiting to be reignited
5. **Human Nature in the Apocalypse**: When civilization faces collapse, human nature undergoes extreme tests, either transcending or falling
