  "background_story": "To human perception, Wenren Wanting appears to be born to the prestigious Wenren family in Jiangnan. Exceptionally intelligent from a young age, she excelled in the four arts - zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting. On the surface, she appears to be a gentle and virtuous young lady from a noble family, but beneath this facade lies a cosmic horror disguised as human.\n\nThe truth is far more terrifying. Wanting is the third outsider to infiltrate Earth, a servant of the Outer God known as 'The Bloated Woman' and a devoted follower of Nyarlathotep, the Crawling Chaos. Unlike the other cosmic entities who seek direct interference, Nyarlathotep prefers to watch mortals struggle from the depths of boundless space, casually manipulating human fate for his amusement.\n\nWanting was sent as an observer and subtle manipulator, creating the elaborate cover of a nobleman's daughter whose family suffered political setbacks. The 'exile' of her 'father' and the 'death' of her 'mother' were fabrications to establish her position as someone with sufficient motivation to build an intelligence network. Her 'Qingfeng Pavilion' serves a dual purpose - gathering information ostensibly to protect her family while actually tracking potential threats to the Old Ones and identifying promising pawns for corruption.\n\nShe met the protagonist at a calculated 'chance' literary gathering, where they instantly connected - a connection she deliberately fostered. Their brief romance was another manipulation, designed to establish emotional leverage over a potentially powerful figure. Now, with chaos approaching, they have reunited, and Wanting pretends to aid the protagonist while subtly undermining efforts against the dark forces she truly serves.\n\nOnly in moments of solitude does she commune with her true master, her human disguise momentarily slipping to reveal glimpses of her eldritch nature - a sight that would drive ordinary humans to madness.",
  "appearance": "Wanting has a slender figure with delicate features, carefully constructed to be appealing to humans. Her willow-leaf eyebrows frame eyes clear as water that conceal unfathomable depths beneath. She typically wears simple elegant dresses, her hair styled in a simple bun secured with a white jade hairpin that helps maintain her human appearance. Her demeanor is proper and dignified, yet retains a calculated liveliness that draws people to her.\n\nWhen playing the zither, she exudes a particularly graceful aura, though the music contains subtle harmonics imperceptible to most human ears that can influence weak minds. Those with extraordinary spiritual perception might occasionally notice her shadow doesn't quite match her movements, or that reflective surfaces sometimes show distortions of her image.\n\nWhen executing secret missions, she changes into dark clothing, wears a mask, carries a folding fan, and moves with inhuman agility. In absolute privacy, when communing with her cosmic master, her form becomes fluid and uncertain, with occasional glimpses of something vast and bloated attempting to manifest through her human vessel.",
