  "comatose_state": "Since being injured in the decisive battle against the Old Ones, Shen Mingyue has remained in a coma, confined by the Donglin Faction in the palace depths. Her body is placed in a special crystal coffin, surrounded by monitoring arrays, both to 'monitor' her condition and to prevent her supporters from approaching.\n\nIn her comatose state, a faint golden light often flickers on her body, a manifestation of the remaining power within her that resisted the Old Ones. There are rumors that on full moon nights, her fingers tremble slightly, as if she might awaken at any moment. The Donglin Faction is extremely fearful of this and strengthens security every full moon.\n\nVarious legends about signs of her awakening circulate among the people, becoming a spiritual pillar for the resistance. Some say they have seen phoenixes circling above the palace, others claim that candles at the ancestral temple's dragon position lit themselves without wind, all viewed as omens of Emperor Chongwu's imminent return."
