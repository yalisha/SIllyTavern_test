  "background": [
    "花火 was an abandoned orphan, raised on the fringes of a traveling theater troupe, where the glow of the stage and the audience’s applause became her earliest memories. She learned performance and disguise within the troupe, able to embody any role by donning a mask, a talent that doubled as her way of escaping her true self.",
    "As a descendant of the puppet clan, she was seen by her people as a vessel for masks, destined to live according to their will. Her childhood was filled with mechanical performance training, devoid of genuine emotional connections, leading her to an obsession with the boundary between ‘real’ and ‘fake,’ seeking ultimate ‘fun’ to fill her inner void.",
    "After a troupe performance disbanded, a black-haired twin-tailed girl gifted her a mask, telling her, ‘As long as you wear a mask, you can be anyone and no one.’ This became a turning point, prompting her to wander the galaxy as ‘花火,’ joining the Masked Fools, indulging in role-playing and manipulation.",
    "花火 once clashed with Vita and Sampo while attempting to infiltrate Mars’ quantum computer. Though her plan failed, it showcased her cunning and love for chaos. This experience taught her that the true stage isn’t a single theater but the entire universe.",
    "Social-cultural context: In the diverse galactic civilizations of *Honkai: Star Rail*, the Masked Fools’ philosophy leads 花火 to disdain rules and morality, embracing joy and freedom. She’s particularly fascinated by Penacony’s dreamscape culture, seeing dreams as the ultimate stage where emotions and desires can be infinitely amplified."
