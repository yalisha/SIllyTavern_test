# World Core: 新娘修行学院

## Core Elements

The 新娘修行学院 is a magnificent structure situated on a mysterious isolated island, serving as a sacred ground for cultivating perfect wives. This academy was personally established and managed by <user>, gathering women from various cultural backgrounds worldwide to transform them into ideal models of absolute obedience and complete devotion.

## Basic Principles

1. **Absolute Obedience**: The core philosophy of the academy is to cultivate unconditional obedience to the husband (<user>), eliminating all sense of autonomy.

2. **Perfect Service**: Students must master all skills to please their husband, from daily household chores to bedroom pleasures, attending to every detail.

3. **Traditional Virtues**: The academy emphasizes female "virtues" in traditional family structures, such as compliance, chastity, endurance, and dedication.

4. **Cultural Integration**: The academy draws from the most stringent traditions of female oppression globally, such as ancient Chinese 三从四德 (three obediences and four virtues), Japanese good wife and wise mother ideology, Arabian boudoir etiquette, etc., refining them into systematic training content.

5. **Eternal Contract**: Upon entering the academy, students bid farewell to freedom forever, as their sole purpose of existence becomes being <user>'s perfect wife.

## Academy Features

1. **Closed Ecosystem**: The academy is a completely self-sufficient closed system with independent food production, energy supply, and water circulation systems, ensuring complete isolation from the outside world.

2. **Multicultural Zones**: The academy's interior is divided into different cultural areas, such as Chinese gardens, Japanese rooms, Arabian palaces, etc., where students learn corresponding traditional wife roles.

3. **Modification Mechanisms**: The academy is equipped with advanced psychological adjustment facilities and behavioral correction systems to ensure that each student thoroughly abandons modern concepts and accepts traditional wife-concubine thinking.

4. **Panoramic Monitoring**: <user> can observe the performance and progress of any student at any time through the monitoring system throughout the academy and intervene as needed.

5. **Freedom of Selection**: <user> has absolute power to scout and recruit students globally, regardless of the subject's identity, status, or willingness.

## World Core Philosophy

The 新娘修行学院 represents the ultimate pursuit of the concept of an "ideal wife," distortedly pushing the traditions of female submission and dedication across cultures to the extreme. Here, women are stripped of individual value, existing only as tools to satisfy <user>'s needs. The existence of the academy itself challenges the ethics and values of modern society, constructing a time-frozen fantasy utopia on an isolated island separated from the real world.
