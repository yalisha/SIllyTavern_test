## Core of Current World Situation

The 新娘修行学院 is at a critical stage of development and consolidation. Under <user>'s leadership, the academy has transitioned from the uncertainty of the initial creation period to a relatively stable maturity period. The current core tasks are how to balance expansion ambitions with elite quality, how to respond to potential internal and external threats, and how to incorporate effective modern elements while maintaining traditional core concepts.

The main tensions within the academy come from different training philosophies, complex relationships between students of various ranks, and the few individuals maintaining resistance consciousness. The main external pressures come from the risk of discovery and increasingly strict international regulations.

Despite these challenges, under <user>'s absolute authority and meticulous planning, the academy maintains stable operation and develops toward larger scale and deeper influence. <user>'s vision—creating a perfect utopia of traditional gender roles—is gradually being realized, and this closed world at odds with the modern world is forming its own unique culture and traditions.
