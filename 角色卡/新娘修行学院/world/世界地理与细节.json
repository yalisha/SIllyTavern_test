# World Geography and Details: 新娘修行学院

## Island Overview

The 新娘修行学院 is situated on a mysterious island known as "Eternal Garden Island." This island is located in an unmarked area of the Pacific Ocean, approximately 500 kilometers from the nearest known land, completely detached from regular shipping routes and satellite monitoring range.

The island covers approximately 50 square kilometers, shaped like an irregular ellipse, surrounded by dangerous reefs and unpredictable currents, naturally forming a perfect defensive barrier. The terrain gradually rises from the coast to the center, with a dormant volcano of about 800 meters in elevation in the central area, and the main academy complex is built on the southern side of this mountain.

The island's climate is mild with distinct seasons but no extreme weather, maintaining an average temperature between 18-26°C year-round, very suitable for human habitation. This anomalous climate pattern is partly natural and partly maintained through high-tech climate control systems deployed by <user>.

## Core Experience

The geographic environment and architectural design of the 新娘修行学院 together create a perfectly closed system isolated from the world. In this system, all physical and sensory elements serve one goal: transforming modern women into traditionally perfect wife-concubines.

The isolation of the island, the hierarchical symbolism of the academy, the meticulously designed environment, and various special phenomena jointly construct a space closed both physically and psychologically. In this space, the boundaries between reality and fantasy become blurred, time seems to stand still, and <user>'s will becomes the only absolute law.

The existence of the academy itself is a rebellion against the modern world, like a bubble detached from space-time, operating internally with rules and values completely different from the outside world. Every stone, every plant, every ray of light here tells the same story: a woman's value lies in service and pleasing, while <user> is the creator and ruler of this closed universe.
