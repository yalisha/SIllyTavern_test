## Core Philosophy

The world rules of the 新娘修行学院 are established on an extreme understanding and execution of traditional gender roles, completely objectifying women as <user>'s accessories and tools for satisfaction. These rules, through a combination of modern technology and traditional concepts, create a completely closed, self-sustaining system where <user>'s power is unlimited, and students are stripped of all autonomy and individual value.

The ultimate purpose of these rules is to create a production line for <user>'s ideal "perfect wives," systematically training and modifying modern women to thoroughly transform them into traditionally defined, absolutely obedient, and completely devoted wife-concubines, satisfying <user>'s fantasies of absolute control and traditional family structures.
