# World View: 新娘修行学院

## World Background

The 新娘修行学院 exists in a parallel universe outwardly identical to the real world, yet with undercurrents of tension. In this world, the struggle for gender equality continues, but there simultaneously exists a secretive power stratum who adhere to traditional patriarchal rule and possess sufficient resources and influence to realize their ideologies. <user> is one of the most visionary and resourceful representatives of this hidden stratum.

## Birth of the 新娘修行学院

As a mysterious figure with unlimited wealth and influence, <user> felt deeply dissatisfied with the growing independence of women and gender equality concepts in modern society. With an extensive resource network, <user> screened and acquired a remote island far from shipping routes and satellite monitoring, establishing this magnificent academic complex on the island.

The academy was founded by integrating modern technology with ancient philosophy, aiming to create a perfect utopia where <user> could shape "perfect wives" according to personal ideals, recreating and reinforcing traditional constraints on women from various cultures.

## World Rules and Characteristics

1. **Secret Existence**: The 新娘修行学院 does not exist in official records, maintaining its secrecy through complex legal barriers, bribery, and threats. The outside world is either unaware of its existence or chooses to ignore it.

2. **Spatial-temporal Displacement**: A special space-time distortion around the island disconnects it perceptually from the mainstream world. A day on the island might equal just minutes in the outside world, ensuring the academy's training process remains undisturbed by external interference.

3. **Absolute Authority**: Within the academy, <user>'s word is law. No external laws, moral standards, or human rights concepts can be implemented on the island. <user> can act entirely according to personal will, unconstrained by any limitations.

4. **Fusion of Technology and Magic**: The modification technologies used by the academy combine cutting-edge science (such as neural reprogramming, biological modification) with ancient mystical arts (such as mental suggestion, sensory manipulation). This fusion creates a form of "technological magic" making modifications to students both efficient and traceless.

5. **Closed Loop**: Once students enter the academy, their past is completely erased. Memories of family and friends are modified, social records are altered, ensuring no one will search for them. To the outside world, these women never existed.

## Social Structure

1. **<user>'s Absolute Rule**: At the top of the academy is <user>, as founder, owner, and sole ruler, having absolute control over every corner of the academy and every student.

2. **Trainer Hierarchy**: Directly serving <user> is a group of specially selected trainers who execute <user>'s commands and manage daily training work. Trainers come from diverse cultural backgrounds and professional fields, ensuring students receive comprehensive traditional wife training.

3. **Student Class System**: Students are classified into different levels according to their degree of submission and skill mastery, from the lowest "newcomers" to the highest "perfect wives." Rising in class comes with increased privileges and improved living conditions, but also implies a deeper level of devotion to <user>.

4. **Logistical Support Personnel**: An invisible workforce maintains the academy's daily operations, including food supply, equipment maintenance, and security. These personnel are rigorously screened, absolutely loyal to <user>, and forbidden from direct contact with students.

## The World Outside the Academy

The external world continues to function according to normal social rules, with gender equality, human rights, and laws constantly evolving. However, there exists a secretive power network composed of like-minded individuals who share <user>'s vision. They have influence globally, helping <user> acquire resources, scout talent, and conceal the academy's existence.

This hidden network has infiltrated governments, corporations, and media, ensuring the 新娘修行学院 will never be discovered or intervened upon by the outside world. They share <user>'s ideology, believing traditional gender roles represent the correct social order, and view <user>'s academy as the last bastion preserving these "precious traditions."

## Core Contradiction in the World View

The core of the 新娘修行学院's world view is the sharp opposition between modern progress and traditional conservatism. It represents an extreme reactionary force attempting to rebuild and intensify gender inequalities that have been condemned and abandoned by mainstream society, all within a secret corner of the world.

This contradiction creates the tension of the academy's existence: it must remain secret to exist, yet yearns to prove the "correctness" of its ideology. This internal conflict makes the academy both a completely closed system and one that constantly draws "fresh blood" from the outside, forming a never-ending cycle.
